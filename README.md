## About Fantasy Filmmakers

Welcome to Fantasy Filmmakers, an ALG Production!

Have you ever thought that though a movie may have been good, it would have been way better had there been a different actor/actress in a particular role? Well, then you have come to the right place.This application is a group project inspired by the concept of creating your own Dreamcast for any movie of your choice. 

Like fantasy sports, the idea of Fantasy Filmmaker is to allow the user the ability to search for any actor or movie that they enjoy and swap out the leading stars for any actor/actress they would prefer for the role. Maybe you enjoyed the Equalizer, but thought Samuel Jackson would give a better performance as Robert McCall than Denzel Washington. Maybe you want Robert de Niro to play Alan Grant in Jurassic Park? All of these options are now available to you here!
